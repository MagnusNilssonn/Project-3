# Battleships

The goal of this project was to test my knowledge and understanding of python coding, I decided quite early on to try a simpler game and the choice fell on battleships, a game that I always appreciated.


## Lucidchart 

- I started to make a Lucidchart to map the workflow for the game.

# Technologies Used:

## Programming Languages:

- Python

## Gitpod

- I used gitpod to write the code

## Github

- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Gitpod

# The Game

- When you start the game you will come to the game field and a welcome message, "You have 15 attempts to find the 2 ships".
You start by choosing row 1-7.
- If you do not select a valid row. It prints :Row must be a number between 1 and 7.

# Testing 

- When I started testing everything worked fine until I typed "Enter" instead of a number or letter and the program crashed which caused me to retype one of the functions. Now it works as I want.
- I installed autopep8 and let it run alongside
- I've tested every possible error I can think of and also ran the code at https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ with no error to report.


# Things to implement in the future

- The option for players to choose diffrent gridsize.
- Multiplayer option if itÂ´s 2 human players who wants to play.
